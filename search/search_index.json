Your time and effort is highly appreciated. Bug Reports & Feature Requests \u00b6 Check the roadmap for upcoming features & fixes. Raise an issue here if you have a feature request or a bug report. Visit the discussions section for Q&A help, feedback, and general discussion. Translating \u00b6 Steps \u00b6 To help translate the plugin to your language: Fork the repository . Copy the entries from src/lang/locale/en.ts to the proper file in src/lang/locale/ (i.e. fr.ts for French, or sw.ts for Swahili). The locale codes are IETF language tags . Translate, Then open a pull request, Example \u00b6 Sample en.ts file: // English export default { EASY : \"Easy\" , SHOW_ANSWER : \"Show Answer\" , DAYS_STR_IVL : \"${interval} days\" , CHECK_ALGORITHM_WIKI : 'For more information, check the <a href=\"${algo_url}\">algorithm implementation</a>.' , }; Equivalent sw.ts file: // Swahili export default { EASY : \"Rahisi\" , SHOW_ANSWER : \"Onyesha Jibu\" , DAYS_STR_IVL : \"Siku ${interval}\" , CHECK_ALGORITHM_WIKI : 'Kwa habari zaidi, angalia <a href=\"${algo_url}\">utekelezaji wa algorithm</a>.' , }; A part of that last one is uhh, Google translated, I have a working understanding of Swahili but not enough to write computerese lol. Please note that: Only the strings(templates) on the right of the key should be translated. Text inside ${} isn't translated. This is used to replace variables in code. For instance, if interval = 4, it becomes 4 days in English & Siku 4 in Swahili. Quite nifty if you ask me. Code \u00b6 Make your changes. Run npm run dev to test the changes inside Obsidian. You could create symbolic links between the build files and the Obsidian vault, example: # remove existing files in the Obsidian vault rm ~/notes/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-spaced-repetition/main.js ~/notes/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-spaced-repetition/manifest.json ~/notes/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-spaced-repetition/styles.css # use absolute paths ln -s /home/stephen/obsidian-spaced-repetition/build/main.js /home/stephen/notes/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-spaced-repetition ln -s /home/stephen/obsidian-spaced-repetition/manifest.json /home/stephen/notes/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-spaced-repetition ln -s /home/stephen/obsidian-spaced-repetition/styles.css /home/stephen/notes/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-spaced-repetition This can be coupled with the Hot Reload plugin Document the \"user-facing\" changes e.g. new feature, UI change, etc. If your \"business logic\" is properly decoupled from Obsidian APIs, write some unit tests. This project uses jest , tests are stored in tests/ . npm run test Add your change to the [Unreleased] section of the changelog ( docs/changelog.md ). The format is based on Keep a Changelog , TL;DR: Added for new features. Changed for changes in existing functionality. Deprecated for soon-to-be removed features. Removed for now removed features. Fixed for any bug fixes. Security in case of vulnerabilities. You can also append a link to your GitHub profile, example: Make flashcard text selectable [@st3v3nmw](https://github.com/st3v3nmw) Before pushing your changes, run the linter: npm run lint Format the code in case any warnings are raised: npm run format Open the pull request. Documentation \u00b6 The documentation consists of Markdown files which MkDocs converts to static web pages. Specifically, this project uses MkDocs Material . These files reside in docs/ in the respective language's folder. For instance, English docs are located in docs/en/ . The docs are served on https://www.stephenmwangi.com/obsidian-spaced-repetition/ . For small changes, you can simply open an pull request for merging (against the master branch). The changes will be live once a new release is made. For larger diffs, it's important that you check how your docs look like as explained below. Viewing Docs Locally \u00b6 Initial Setup \u00b6 Create a virtual environment: python3 -m venv venv Activate it: . venv/bin/activate Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt Viewing \u00b6 Activate the virtual environment: . venv/bin/activate Serve the docs: mkdocs serve View your documentation locally on http://127.0.0.1:8000/obsidian-spaced-repetition/ , any changes you make will reflect on the browser instantly. Translating Documentation \u00b6 Create a folder for your language in docs/ if it doesn't exist. Use the language codes provided here . Add the code from (1) to the MkDocs configuration ( mkdocs.yml - plugins.i18n.languages ). Copy the files from the English ( en ) folder into the new folder. Translate then open a pull request. Maintenance \u00b6 Releases \u00b6 Example using v1.9.2 : Create a new branch: git switch -c release-v1.9.2 Bump the plugin version in manifest.json and package.json (following Semantic Versioning ). Semantic Versioning TL;DR, given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH , increment the: MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes If the new version uses new Obsidian APIs, update minAppVersion and versions.json to reflect this. Update the changelog ( docs/changelog.md ); use the new version to replace the [Unreleased] section. Commit and push the changes: git add . git commit -m \"Bump version to v1.9.2\" git push --set-upstream origin release-v1.9.2 Open and merge the PR into master . Locally, switch back to master and pull the changes: git switch master && git pull Create a git tag with the version: git tag 1.9.2 Push the tag: git push --tags . You're all set! This GitHub action should pick it up, create a release, publish it, and update the live documentation.

Using Folder Structure \u00b6 The plugin will automatically search for folders that contain flashcards & use their paths to create decks & sub-decks i.e. Folder/sub-folder/sub-sub-folder \u21d4 Deck/sub-deck/sub-sub-deck . This is an alternative to the tagging option and can be enabled in settings. Reviewing \u00b6 Once done creating cards, click on the flashcards button on the left ribbon to start reviewing the flashcards. After a card is reviewed, a HTML comment is added containing the next review day, the interval, and the card's ease. <!--SR:!2021-08-20,13,290--> Wrapping in a HTML comment makes the scheduling information not visible in the notes preview. For single-line cards, you can choose whether you want the HTML comment on the same line or on a separate line in the settings. Putting them on the same line prevents breaking of list structures in the preview or after auto-formatting. Note that you can skip a card by simply pressing S (case doesn't matter). Tip If you're experiencing issues with the size of the modal on mobile devices, go to settings and set the Flashcard Height Percentage and Flashcard Width Percentage to 100% to maximize it. Faster Review \u00b6 To review faster, use the following keyboard shortcuts: Space/Enter => Show answer 0 => Reset card's progress (Sorta like Again in Anki) 1 => Review as Hard 2 or Space => Review as Good 3 => Review as Easy Context \u00b6 If the parent note has heading(s), the flashcard will have a title containing the context. Taking the following note: #flashcards # Trivia ## Capitals ### Africa Kenya::Nairobi ### North America Canada::Ottawa The flashcard for Kenya::Nairobi will have Trivia > Capitals > Africa as the context/title whereas the flashcard for Canada::Ottawa will have Trivia > Capitals > North America as the context/title. Deleting cards \u00b6 To delete a card, simply delete the scheduling information & the card text. Ignoring cards \u00b6 You can wrap flashcards in HTML comments e.g. <!--Card text <!--SR:2021-08-20,13,290--> --> to prevent it from showing up in your review queues. You can always remove the wrapping comment later. Cramming \u00b6 Currently, the only supported method is \"cramming\" all cards in a note using the Cram flashcards in this note command. Will work on a per-deck across-all-notes method. Statistics \u00b6 The statistics section can be accessed using the View Statistics command. Forecast \u00b6 Stats on the number of cards due in the future. Intervals \u00b6 Stats on delays until cards are shown again. Eases \u00b6 Stats on card eases. Card Types \u00b6 Stats on card types: New, Young, Mature (Have intervals more than 1 month).","title":"Flashcards"},{"location":"flashcards/#flashcards","text":"","title":"Flashcards"},{"location":"flashcards/#creating","text":"Piotr Wozniak's 20 rules of knowledge formulation is a great introduction on proper flashcard creation.","title":"Creating"},{"location":"flashcards/#single-line-basic-remnote-style","text":"The prompt and the answer are separated by :: (this can be configured in settings). the question goes on this side::answer goes here!","title":"Single-line Basic (Remnote style)"},{"location":"flashcards/#single-line-reversed","text":"Creates two cards side1:::side2 & the reversed version side2:::side1 .
